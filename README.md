# CS50x

During summer 2015, I had the opportunity to follow the Harvard online course of Introduction to Compuer Science (CS50x), taught by David J. Malan.

During these 180 hours of courses, I have made different projects and you can find the source code here.

The following problem sets (pset) are currently online:

##pset1
A really simple problem set to learn the basic of coding and C.
###hello.c
The most simple program in the world that prints "Hello world!" to the console.
###mario.c
Fun C program that prints a semi-pyramid to the consol
###greedy.c
Really useful and simple program that indicate the simple way to give change.

##pset2
A problem set to understand ASCII math.
###initials.c
Really simple program that retreives the initials of a given name.
###caesar.c & viginiere.c
This is two cryptographic programs. Really fun to do (and to use!)

##pset3
A fun problem set, introducing graphic user interface
###find.c
Simple program to find something in a given input. Practicing binary search.
###breakout.c
A fun game developed in C, wiht a graphic interface library from Standford

##pset4
A really fun problem set to learn how to work and the structure of files images
###recover.c
This program in C aims to recover data from a lost sd card
###whodunit.c
A image with a lot of red points was given, and this programs aims to delete every red pixels
###resize.c
Simple program that resize a given image

##pset5
Maybe the hardest problem set. The objective was to implement a spell checker with the best memory usage
##dictionnary.c
This file is used to run spell.c. A great exercise to understand hashtable and linked list. Hard a really hard time on this one, but was fun after all.

##pset6
One my favorite pset because it was really gratifying, and was able to wrote a HTTP server in C. How awesome is that?
##server.c
This is my own HTTP server :)

##pset7
Also one of my favorite problem set which goal was to code a little website using JavaScript (jQuery here), HTML/CSS, PHP and MySQL. This website is a stock market game where the user can create an account, buy and sell shares (based on Yahoo Finance), see its history and add fund to its portfolio. 

##pset8
Really fun problem set that is using the Google Maps JavaScript API v3. This website, coded thanks to JavaScript (no jQuery here), HTML/CSS, MySQL and PHP, allows the user to consult a Google Map with Google News embedded.
